	Obviously, A is either innocent or guilty. But whichever he is, D is guilty. Here's the proof. First, suppose A is innocent. Then, by (4), D is guilty. Now, suppose instead that A is guilty. Then one of B and C is also guilty (by 2) and if B is guilty, so is C (by 1, since we're assuming for the moment that A is guilty). This shows that if A is guilty, so is C regardless of whether B is. But (3) tells us that if C is guilty, so is D. Putting these two facts together, we see that if A is guilty, so is D. So regardless of A's status, D is guilty. The rest are uncertain (it's possible for all we're told that D acted alone, or D may have acted with A, B, and C, among other possibilities)
